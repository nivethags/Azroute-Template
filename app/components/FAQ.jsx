      question: "What programs does Azroute Chess Institute offer?",
      answer:
        "We offer level-based group classes (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), dedicated kids batches, adult batches, 1-on-1 coaching, tournament preparation, opening repertoire building, tactics/endgame intensives, weekend bootcamps, and regular practice tournaments with game analysis."
    },
    {
      question: "How do live online classes work?",
      answer:
        "Classes run in real time over video with an interactive chessboard. Coaches annotate positions, review student games, assign homework, and take Q&A. You can chat, solve positions live, and get instant feedback—just like an in-person session, but from home."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide certificates or official ratings?",
      answer:
        "We issue course completion certificates for our programs. Official chess ratings are managed by federations (e.g., FIDE/state associations). We prepare you for rated events and guide you on how to participate to earn or improve your rating."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I access class materials after sessions?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Students get access to class recordings (where available), PGN files of analyzed games, study notes, and curated puzzle sets inside the student dashboard for a set period after each session."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I miss a live class?",
      answer:
        "No problem—recordings are shared (where available) so you can catch up. You can also request a makeup in another batch or a short 1-on-1 recap, subject to coach and slot availability."
